The famous book by Alan Turing on Computing Machinery and Intelligence was already such a massive foundation on which artificial intelligence stands. His invention of the Turing test thought experiment meant to determine whether the machine can be said to think continues to make its impact felt; he's working on the possibility of a machine thinking for itself, entertainingly, which was of course visionary as well as provocative.
Although Turing's work does provide a fair framework with which one could understand AI, there are various questions arising that are related to its ultimate model. Examples include: Are machines ever conscious? Do they possess sentience? Can machines experience emotion or subjective experience? These dilemmas continue to form an area of argument in today's society.
Perhaps the limitation of Turing's time, but the work does establish a basis for the kinds of advancements that are being implemented today in AI. Maybe the standalone ideas of language models for self-driving cars seem new; however, they all owe a thread back to Turing's works that inspire researchers and developers to break out of what is possible.
